Readme

This is an angular based project which displays student information and calculates GPA based on course grades.

The student data is fetched from local storage since the JSON file was not on server and the browser does not support file protocol

Itâ€™s a single page app which has an interactive UI to add and delete student information along with their course grades.  

The rows with the min/max GPA are highlighted accordingly. 

The added record will reflect in the table and the GPA min/max row is  recalculated and highlighted accordingly. The same goes for remove functionality. Since the data is stored locally the changes will be short-lived until web page is active

I have used Bootstrap4 and CSS for styling the page. 

Functionalities 
a) Add student record
b) Remove  student record
c) Calculate GPA
